# airbnb-clone-project
This project is a full-stack clone of the popular accommodation booking platform AirBnB. The goal is to build a functional web application that allows users to browse property listings, view detailed property information, and complete bookings. The project will cover frontend development, backend APIs, database design, and deployment.

## UI/UX Design Planning
Design Goals
Simplicity & Clarity – Ensure the interface is easy to navigate with minimal learning curve.

Property Details Page with photos, amenities list, reviews, location map, and host details.
Booking System with date picker, guest selection, and dynamic pricing.
Checkout Process with clear cost breakdown and simple payment flow.
User Accounts for hosts and guests (profile management, booking history, hosting dashboard).

A user-friendly design is crucial in a booking system because:
Reduces Friction: A simple and intuitive flow encourages users to complete their bookings instead of abandoning midway.
Builds Trust: Clear pricing, transparent policies, and secure checkout reassure users about their purchase.
Boosts Engagement: Smooth navigation and well-placed calls-to-action guide users naturally through the booking journey
Supports Accessibility: Inclusive design ensures that all users (including those with disabilities) can easily book.
Increases Conversions: A streamlined experience translates directly into higher booking rates and satisfied customers.
